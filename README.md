# PaskiDev Website

First this website is created to demonstrate part of my knowledge creating websites, like an interactive portfolio, but a bit far from that.
I want to create a blog section to write about some things related with website and app development, learn and investigate new programming languages, new frameworks, new libraries... Talk about architectures, methodologies and all those things.

## Which tech stack i'll be using?

Frontend:

- HTML (Required)
- CSS -> TailwindCSS
- JavaScript/TypeScript
  - React
  - NextJS (Probably)
  - ThreeJS
  - ChartJS

Backend:

- Go
- Python
- Node (Probably)

## Which things will be published in this repo?

In this repo will be things related to the frontend environment at most. The backend languages commented before is just an idea of what I want, maybe I use Rust or other programming language like C, for the moment I don't care. Otherwise, if I create an API I think I'll better use Go. Everything depends in everything.

Some things related with authorisations, user logins and register will be not uploaded to this repo. So everything using that will have their own components and so on. At least this is how I want to organize the project.
